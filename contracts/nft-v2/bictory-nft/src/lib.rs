//! A NFT smart contract example using the Concordium Token Standard CIS1.
//!
//! # Description
//! An instance of this smart contract can contain a number of different token
//! each identified by a token ID. A token is then globally identified by the
//! contract address together with the token ID.
//!
//! In this example the contract is initialized with no tokens, and tokens can
//! be minted through a `mint` contract function, which will only succeed for
//! the contract owner. No functionality to burn token is defined in this
//! example.
//!
//! Note: The word 'address' refers to either an account address or a
//! contract address.
//!
//! As follows from the CIS1 specification, the contract has a `transfer`
//! function for transferring an amount of a specific token type from one
//! address to another address. An address can enable and disable one or more
//! addresses as operators. An operator of some address is allowed to transfer
//! any tokens owned by this address.
